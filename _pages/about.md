I'm a second year Master's student at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu) of the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu). I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe) in my research and [Dr. Michael Shamos](http://euro.ecom.cmu.edu/shamos.html) in my capstone.

I'm generally interested in improving speech and language processing. My current projects involve **speech translation**, **multilingual speech recognition**, and **spoken language understanding** with end-to-end approaches.

Previously, I was a Technology Strategy Consultant at [Accenture](https://accenture.com/strategy/consulting). I completed my undergraduate degree in Economics and Computer Science at [The University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu).

You can find my CV as of December 2020 [here](https:assets/cv.pdf)
